#Installing required packages
packages = c('quantmod','car','forecast','tseries','FinTS', 'rugarch','utf8','ggplot2')
lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)

```

#Downloading the required data

getSymbols(Symbols = 'ITC', 
           src = 'yahoo', 
           from = as.Date('2012-01-01'), 
           to = as.Date('2023-12-31'),

Report:

Objective: To analyze the daily returns of stock from 2012-01-01 to 2023-12-31. 

Analysis: Extracted the adjusted closing prices of data stock, calculated daily returns, and visualized them. 

Result: The 'data_return' plot displays the daily returns of stock over the specified period. 

Implication: The plot indicates the volatility and direction of daily returns for stock during the given timeframe.


```{r}
#Checking the stationarity of returns
adf_test = adf.test(data_return); adf_test


```
Report:

Objective: To conduct an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity on the daily returns of stock.

Analysis: Performed the ADF test using the 'adf.test' function and obtained results.

Result: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on data daily returns yields the following p-value: 0.01 - with Null hypothesis that data is non-stationary and Alternate hypothesis that data is stationery.

Implication: The ADF test suggests that the daily returns of data stock are likely stationary. The small p-value (0.01) indicates evidence against the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that data is Non-stationary.


```{r}
#Check for Autocorrlation in Data
# Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation
lb_test = Box.test(data_return); lb_test

```
Report:

Objective: To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the daily returns of stock. 

Analysis: Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function and obtained results. 

Result: The Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on data daily returns yields the following p-value: 2.2e-16 with null hypothesis that data is not autocorrelated and alternate hypothesis that data is autocorrelated.

Implication: The Ljung-Box test indicates significant autocorrelation in the data. The small p-value (2.2e-16) suggests evidence to reject the the null hypothesis and data has autocorrelation.Now, we need to use arima to remodel the data.

```{r}
#Plot of ACF and PCF
acf(data_return) 
pacf(data_return) 

```

Report:

Objective: To plot acf and pacf of data to determine p lags and q lags.

Analysis: We use acf and Pacf function of R to plot. Model used is ARIMA i.e. AR (p-Lag) Model : y(t) = c1 + a1*y(t-1) + a2*y(t-2) + ... + ap*y(t-p) + e(t) where e = error == White Noise | AR-1 Model : y(t) = c + a1*y(t-1) + e(t), MA (q-Lag) Model : y(t) = c2 + b1*e(t-1) + b2*e(t-2) + ... + bp*e(t-p) where e = Error == White Noise | MA-1 Model : y(t) = d + b1*e(t-1), ARMA (p, q) Model : y(t) = c + a1*y(t-1) + ... + ap*y(t-p) + b1*e(t-1) + ... + bp*e(t-p) + e(t) | ARMA (1, 1)

Result: Acf shows correlation between series and its lagged value, however pacf shows correlation between series and its lagged value after removing effects of intervening lags. Blueline shows 95% values lie between them. 

Implication: Using ACF plot we can interpret that first spike between blue lines come at near 4, So q lag is 4 while similarly in PACF plot it is at 5, So, P lag is 5. So, according to plots arima order should be (5,0,4)


```{r}
#Using Auto arima 
arma_pq = auto.arima(data_return); arma_pq

```

Report:

Objective: To remodel data using auto arima.

Analysis: We use "auto.arima" function of R to plot.

Result: It also shows same lags as we identified before.

Implication: Now we will use transformed data for further analysis.


```{r}
#Checking of Autocorrelation in transformed data after auto arima
lb_test_A = Box.test(arma_pq$residuals); lb_test_A

```


Report:

Objective: To perform a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the transformed data. 

Analysis: Conducted the Ljung-Box test using the 'Box.test' function and obtained results. 

Result: The Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation yields the following p-value: 0.4154 with null hypothesis that data is not autocorrelated and alternate hypothesis that data is autocorrelated.

Implication: The Ljung-Box test indicates no significant autocorrelation in the data. The p-value (0.4154) suggests evidence to accept the the null hypothesis and data has no autocorrelation now.


```{r}
#Forecast of Arima model
ds_fpq = forecast(arma_pq, h = 500)
plot(ds_fpq)

```

Report:

Objective: To forecast the prices using arima model.

Analysis: For this, the forecast function of R is used.

Result: Plot shows the prediction of next 500 steps, which means as we had daily data. It shows prediction for next 500 days.

Implication: This plot shows that data will be steadily constant over time as it is reflected in historical data.


```{r}
#Checking for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: Arch test

data_ret_sq = arma_pq$residuals^2
data_ret_arch_test = ArchTest(data_ret_sq, lags = 10) 
data_ret_arch_test
```

Report:

Objective: To test for volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the residuals of the ARIMA(5, 0, 4) model. 

Analysis: Conducted Box ARCH test on the squared residuals to assess the presence of volatility clustering. 

Results: Arch test yields the p value of 2.2e-16, with null hypothesis that there is no arch effect and alternate hypothesis tells presence of Arch effect.

Implications: It means we can reject null hypothesis and it means data contains Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity, which mean we need to do garch modelling to transform data to white noise.


```{r}
#Garch Modelling
garch_model1 = ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = 'sGARCH', garchOrder = c(1,1)), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(5,4), include.mean = TRUE))
ret_garch1 = ugarchfit(garch_model1, data = data_ret_sq); ret_garch1

```



Report:

Objective: To transform the data to remove volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity.

Analysis: We used ugarchfit and ugarchspec to do this.

Result: We found the data with following characterstics: Sign Bias:	2.4628779	, Negative Sign Bias:	0.4037908	Positive Sign Bias	4.5236680, Joint Effect	20.7276940

Implication: Now, we can ue this data forecasting.

```{r}
stk_ret_garch_forecast1 = ugarchforecast(ret_garch1, n.ahead = 500); stk_ret_garch_forecast1

```




```{r}
plot(stk_ret_garch_forecast1)
```



Report:

Objective: To predict future values using garch model

Analysis: We used "forecast" and "Plot" fuction of R.

Result: It predicts constant stock return in future.

Implication: It can be used to predict stock may not have growth prospects in future.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
